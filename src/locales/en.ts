    "am.hero_p1": "While the cabin crew serve passengers at 35,000 feet, it is the <strong>ground staff</strong> who ensure every flight departs on time, every passenger boards safely, and every piece of luggage reaches its destination. If cabin crew are the face of an airline, ground staff are the <em>backbone</em>—the operational engine that keeps the entire aviation ecosystem running.",
    "am.hero_p2": "At <strong>Wings Institute, Vadodara</strong>—Gujarat's oldest and largest aviation training institute since 2008—we have specifically designed our <strong>Airport Management programme</strong> for candidates who seek <em>stability</em>, <em>technical skill development</em>, and <em>long-term job security</em> over the glamour of constant travel.

    "am.faq_title_seo": "Frequently Asked Questions: Airport Ground Staff",
    "am.faq_intro": "Here are answers to the most common questions we receive from students interested in airport ground staff careers:",
    "am.faq1_q": "What is the salary of airport ground staff in India?",
    "am.faq1_a": "Airport ground staff salaries in India range from <strong>₹18,000-25,000 per month for freshers</strong> (Customer Service Agent) to <strong>₹45,000-80,000 for experienced Duty Managers</strong>. International ground handling companies like SATS, Celebi, and Menzies offer even higher packages. With 5-7 years of experience, you can reach Airport Manager level with salaries exceeding ₹1 Lakh per month.",
    "am.faq2_q": "Is there any height requirement for airport ground staff?",
    "am.faq2_a": "<strong>No</strong>, there are no strict height requirements for ground staff positions unlike cabin crew roles. Airlines and ground handling companies focus on your communication skills, professional appearance, and technical knowledge rather than physical attributes like height. This makes ground staff careers accessible to a wider range of candidates.",
    "am.faq3_q": "What is the difference between ground staff and cabin crew?",
    "am.faq3_a": "Cabin crew work <strong>inside the aircraft</strong> during flights, while ground staff work at the <strong>airport terminal</strong>. Ground staff handle check-in, boarding, baggage, security, and customer service on the ground. Ground staff enjoy more stable schedules, work near their home city, have no height restrictions, and experience less physical strain compared to cabin crew who travel constantly.",
    "am.faq4_q": "Can I get a job at Vadodara Airport after this course?",
    "am.faq4_a": "<strong>Yes, absolutely.</strong> Harni Airport (Vadodara) has regular recruitment drives for ground staff positions. Our alumni work at Vadodara Airport with airlines like IndiGo, SpiceJet, and Air India. We also place students at the larger Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in Ahmedabad, which is just 100 km away and offers more opportunities.",
    "am.faq5_q": "What is AVSEC training and why is it important?",
    "am.faq5_a": "<strong>AVSEC stands for Aviation Security.</strong> It covers X-ray screening, passenger frisking, dangerous goods identification, and threat response protocols. AVSEC certification is mandatory for many airport security positions and gives you a significant edge in interviews. Wings Institute is one of the few institutes in India that includes AVSEC awareness training in the curriculum.",
    "am.faq6_q": "Do I need to know English to become airport ground staff?",
    "am.faq6_a": "Basic English communication is essential since you'll interact with passengers from across India and abroad. However, if you're from a Gujarati or Hindi medium background, don't worry—our <strong>Cambridge Spoken English module</strong> transforms you into a confident English speaker. Over 70% of our students start with limited English and become fluent by graduation.",
    "am.faq7_q": "What is CRS/GDS training and which software will I learn?",
    "am.faq7_a": "CRS (Computer Reservation System) and GDS (Global Distribution System) are airline booking software used worldwide. At Wings Institute, you'll receive hands-on training on <strong>Amadeus and Galileo</strong>—the two most widely used systems globally. This technical skill makes you valuable for ticketing counters, travel agencies, and airline reservation desks.",
    "am.faq8_q": "Is airport ground staff a good career for males?",
    "am.faq8_a": "<strong>Absolutely.</strong> In fact, ground staff roles like Ramp Agent, Cargo Handler, Security Executive, and Operations Supervisor have a high percentage of male employees. These roles involve logistics, security protocols, and operational management—areas where male candidates often excel and find long-term career satisfaction.",
    "am.faq9_q": "What is the age limit for airport ground staff jobs?",
    "am.faq9_a": "Most airlines and ground handling companies hire candidates between <strong>18-28 years</strong> for entry-level positions. However, unlike cabin crew (which has stricter age limits), ground staff can continue working well into their 50s with career progression into management roles. This makes it a stable, long-term career choice.",
    "am.faq10_q": "How long does it take to get placed after completing the course?",
    "am.faq10_a": "On average, dedicated students receive job offers within <strong>3-6 months</strong> of course completion. Some students get placed even before graduation during campus recruitment drives. We provide <strong>unlimited placement assistance</strong>—meaning we continue sending you for interviews until you're placed, regardless of how long it takes.",

    // --- HOTEL MANAGEMENT SEO FAQs (English) ---
    "hm.seo_faq1_q": "What is the difference between a 3-year hotel management degree and a 1-year diploma?",
    "hm.seo_faq1_a": "A 3-year degree focuses heavily on theory, general education subjects, and academic credentials. A 1-year diploma like ours focuses 100% on practical, job-ready skills. In hospitality, hotels hire based on skills, grooming, and attitude—not marksheets. Our diploma + 6-month internship gets you earning 2 years before a degree holder even graduates. This is the Gujarat Paradigm: faster ROI through focused vocational training.",
    "hm.seo_faq2_q": "What are the hotel management course fees in Vadodara?",
    "hm.seo_faq2_a": "Hotel management course fees vary significantly across institutes. At Wings Institute, we offer comprehensive fee packages that include all training materials, practical lab access, internship placement assistance, and multiple certifications. We also provide EMI options and merit-based scholarships. Contact our admissions counsellor at +91-87587-54444 for exact fee details and current offers.",
    "hm.seo_faq3_q": "Is cooking compulsory in hotel management?",
    "hm.seo_faq3_a": "No, cooking is just one of four major departments in hotel management. You can specialise in Front Office (reception, guest relations), F&B Service (restaurant management), Housekeeping (room operations), or Food Production (culinary). Many successful hotel professionals never enter the kitchen—Front Office and Housekeeping managers often have the highest career growth in hotel chains.",
    "hm.seo_faq4_q": "Do students get paid during the hotel internship?",
    "hm.seo_faq4_a": "Yes! All Wings Institute students undergo a mandatory 6-month industrial training in 5-star properties like Taj, Marriott, Hyatt, and ITC. Students typically receive a monthly stipend ranging from ₹1,500 to ₹5,000 depending on the property and location. Many students also receive tips, meals, and accommodation. More importantly, 60-70% of interns receive permanent job offers from their internship hotels.",
    "hm.seo_faq5_q": "Can I work on cruise ships after hotel management?",
    "hm.seo_faq5_a": "Absolutely! Hotel management graduates are highly sought after by international cruise liners like Royal Caribbean, Carnival, and MSC. Cruise jobs offer tax-free salaries of ₹80,000-2,00,000 per month with free food, accommodation, and travel. However, most cruise companies require 1-2 years of onshore 5-star hotel experience before hiring, which is why our internship programme is so valuable.",
    "hm.seo_faq6_q": "What is the salary of a hotel management fresher in India?",
    "hm.seo_faq6_a": "Hotel management freshers in India typically start at ₹15,000-25,000 per month in domestic 3-4 star properties. In 5-star chains like Taj, Oberoi, and Marriott, starting salaries range from ₹18,000-30,000 plus tips, meals, and accommodation. International hotels in Dubai, Qatar, and Singapore offer ₹50,000-80,000 for freshers. With 3-5 years of experience, salaries can reach ₹50,000-1,00,000 in supervisory roles.",
    "hm.seo_faq7_q": "What equipment and labs does Wings Institute have for practical training?",
    "hm.seo_faq7_a": "Wings Institute has industry-grade infrastructure including: a Fine-Dine Mock Restaurant with formal table settings, silverware, and service stations; a Commercial Kitchen with high-pressure burners, industrial ovens, bakery equipment, and professional cutlery; a Front Office Lab with PMS software training; and Housekeeping training. Students practice on real equipment used in 5-star hotels.",
    "hm.seo_faq8_q": "What is Front Office in hotel management?",
    "hm.seo_faq8_a": "Front Office is the 'face' of the hotel—the first and last point of contact for guests. Front Office executives handle check-in/check-out, reservations, guest complaints, billing (night audit), concierge services, and VIP guest relations. This department uses Property Management Systems (PMS) like Opera, Fidelio, and IDS. Front Office roles often have the fastest career progression to General Manager positions.",
    "hm.seo_faq9_q": "Can I open my own restaurant or café after this course?",
    "hm.seo_faq9_a": "Yes! Many of our alumni have successfully launched their own restaurants, cafés, cloud kitchens, and catering businesses in Vadodara, Ahmedabad, and across Gujarat. Our curriculum covers food costing, menu planning, kitchen management, and customer service—essential skills for entrepreneurship. We also teach basic business operations as part of our hospitality training.",
    "hm.seo_faq10_q": "Is there any age limit for hotel management course?",
    "hm.seo_faq10_a": "Our hotel management programme accepts candidates aged 17-28 years. Unlike aviation where strict age limits apply for cabin crew, hospitality careers have no upper age restrictions for employment. You can start as a Front Office Executive at 20 and continue working until retirement, progressing through supervisory and management roles. This makes hospitality a stable, long-term career choice.",

    // Section 6: FAQ SEO Content
    "cu.faq_seo_title": "Frequently Asked Questions: Culinary Arts Course",
    "cu.faq_seo_intro": "Answers to the most common questions from aspiring chefs and their families:",
    "cu.seo_faq1_q": "What is the difference between a culinary arts course and a chef course?",
    "cu.seo_faq1_a": "Culinary arts is a broader term encompassing all aspects of food preparation, presentation, and kitchen management. A chef course is typically part of culinary arts training. At Wings Institute, our Professional Certificate in Culinary Arts covers cooking techniques, bakery, confectionery, food service, and kitchen management—making you a complete culinary professional, not just a cook.",
    "cu.seo_faq2_q": "Can I open my own café or cloud kitchen after this course?",
    "cu.seo_faq2_a": "Absolutely! Our curriculum specifically covers menu planning, food costing, vendor management, kitchen hygiene (FSSAI compliance), and basic business operations. Many of our alumni have successfully launched cafés, cloud kitchens, and catering businesses across Vadodara, Ahmedabad, and other Gujarat cities. The rise of Swiggy and Zomato has made cloud kitchens a low-investment, high-return business opportunity.",
    "cu.seo_faq3_q": "What equipment will I train on at Wings Institute?",
    "cu.seo_faq3_a": "You'll train on industry-grade commercial kitchen equipment including: high-pressure gas burners (6-12 burner ranges), industrial convection ovens, salamanders, deep fryers, planetary mixers for bakery, proofing cabinets, commercial refrigeration units, stainless steel workstations, and professional knife sets. This ensures you're job-ready from day one—no adjustment period needed when you join a hotel kitchen.",
    "cu.seo_faq4_q": "Do you teach Indian cuisine including tandoor cooking?",
    "cu.seo_faq4_a": "Yes, Indian cuisine is a major module in our curriculum. You'll learn regional curries (Punjabi, South Indian, Gujarati, Mughlai), tandoor cooking on an actual tandoor oven, biryani preparation, Indian breads (naan, roti, paratha), and traditional desserts (gulab jamun, kheer, halwa). We also cover modern plating techniques for Indian dishes.",
    "cu.seo_faq5_q": "Is bakery and cake decoration included in the course?",
    "cu.seo_faq5_a": "Yes, our Bakery & Confectionery module covers bread making (white bread, whole wheat, focaccia), pastries (puff pastry, croissants), cakes (sponge, pound, chiffon), cake decoration (piping, fondant work, ganache), cookies, and desserts. You'll learn both egg-based and eggless variants to cater to all customer preferences.",
    "cu.seo_faq6_q": "What is the salary of a fresher chef in India?",
    "cu.seo_faq6_a": "Fresher chefs (Commis III) in India typically start at ₹12,000-18,000 per month in 3-star properties. In 5-star hotels like Taj, Oberoi, and Marriott, starting salaries range from ₹15,000-25,000 plus meals and accommodation. International hotels in Dubai, Qatar, and cruise ships offer ₹40,000-80,000 for experienced commis chefs. Executive Chefs can earn ₹1-3 Lakhs per month.",
    "cu.seo_faq7_q": "Why can't I learn cooking at home instead of joining a course?",
    "cu.seo_faq7_a": "Home cooking and professional cooking are completely different. Commercial kitchens use high-pressure gas burners that generate 10x more heat than home stoves, industrial equipment, standardised recipes for consistency, HACCP food safety protocols, and volume cooking techniques. Training on home equipment will leave you unprepared for the speed, precision, and hygiene standards of professional kitchens.",
    "cu.seo_faq8_q": "Do I need to know English to become a chef?",
    "cu.seo_faq8_a": "While kitchen terminology is often in French/English, you don't need fluent English to start. However, for career growth—especially in 5-star hotels or international positions—English communication is essential. Our Cambridge Spoken English module transforms vernacular students into confident English speakers, covering hospitality vocabulary and kitchen terminology.",
    "cu.seo_faq9_q": "What are cloud kitchens and why are they popular in Gujarat?",
    "cu.seo_faq9_a": "Cloud kitchens (also called ghost kitchens) are delivery-only restaurants without dine-in facilities. They operate through Swiggy, Zomato, and direct delivery. Gujarat's growing food delivery market, lower rental costs, and entrepreneurial culture make cloud kitchens a lucrative opportunity. You can start a cloud kitchen with ₹5-10 Lakhs investment—far less than a traditional restaurant.",
    "cu.seo_faq10_q": "Can I work on cruise ships after this culinary course?",
    "cu.seo_faq10_a": "Yes! Cruise lines actively recruit trained chefs for their onboard restaurants. Cruise chef salaries range from ₹60,000-1,50,000 per month (tax-free) with free food and accommodation. However, most cruise companies require 1-2 years of land-based hotel experience first. Our 6-month internship in 5-star hotels helps you build this experience.",

    // Section 1: Infrastructure
    "hpSeo.infra_title": "Gujarat's Only In-House Airbus A330 Training Centre",
    "hpSeo.infra_p1": "When it comes to air hostess training and cabin crew courses in Gujarat, infrastructure isn't a luxury—it's a necessity. While generic coaching centres teach from PowerPoint slides and textbooks, Wings Institute Vadodara trains you inside an actual aircraft fuselage. This isn't marketing hyperbole; it's the fundamental difference between students who struggle in airline interviews and those who clear them confidently.",
    "hpSeo.infra_h3_mock": "The Airbus A330 Mock Cabin: Why It Matters",
    "hpSeo.infra_p2": "Our campus houses Gujarat's only Airbus A330 wide-body aircraft mock cabin—a 24-seat business class configuration featuring:",

    "hpSeo.infra_quote": "Airlines don't hire students who have only read about emergency evacuations; they hire students who have performed them. When you've practiced a 90-second evacuation drill 50 times, the airline interview becomes a formality.",

    "hpSeo.infra_p4": "This infrastructure-first approach is why our students consistently outperform candidates from \"theory-only\" institutes during practical assessments at airline and hotel interviews.",

    // AIR HOSTESS SEO CONTENT PAGE (ah.*) - Extended
    // ==========================================================

    // Section 1: Hero Narrative
    "ah.hero_title": "Professional Air Hostess & Cabin Crew Training in Vadodara",
    "ah.hero_p1": "The skies have always captured human imagination. For many young aspirants across Gujarat—from Surat to Rajkot, from Ahmedabad to Vadodara—the dream of donning that immaculate cabin crew uniform and walking down the aisle at 35,000 feet is a powerful motivator. But let us be absolutely clear from the outset: becoming a professional **air hostess** or **cabin crew member** is not merely about glamour. It is about rigorous training, split-second decision-making during emergencies, and the ability to deliver exceptional service under pressure.",
    "ah.hero_p2": "At **Wings Institute, Vadodara**—Gujarat's oldest and largest aviation training institute since 2008—we have trained thousands of young men and women who now fly with prestigious carriers including **Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Indigo Airlines, Air India, and Vistara**. Our approach is fundamentally different from certificate-churning factories: we focus on *career outcomes*, not just course completion.",
    "ah.wings_advantage_title": "The Wings Advantage: In-House Airbus A330 Mock Cabin",
    "ah.wings_advantage_intro": "We are the **only institute in Gujarat** with a full-scale **Airbus A330 mock aircraft** on campus. This is not a scaled model or a photograph—it is a fully functional training simulator where you will conduct:",
    "ah.advantage_safety": "**Safety Drills:** Water evacuation procedures for emergency landing scenarios on water bodies",
    "ah.advantage_evacuation": "**Emergency Evacuation:** 90-second evacuation protocols, slide deployment, and passenger crowd management",
    "ah.advantage_fire": "**Fire Fighting Drills:** Using fire extinguishers, smoke hoods, and containment procedures at altitude",
    "ah.advantage_pa": "**PA Announcements:** Professional voice modulation for in-flight announcements in English and Hindi",
    "ah.advantage_meal": "**Meal Service Simulation:** Using actual airline trolleys to master in-flight service protocols",
    "ah.hero_p3": "Why does this matter? Because airlines do not hire candidates who have only read textbooks. During your airline interview—whether at **Ahmedabad International Airport** or Mumbai—you will be tested on practical scenarios. Students who have physically practised safety drills and emergency evacuation in a realistic environment consistently outperform those who have not. This is the difference between theoretical knowledge and *muscle memory* that kicks in during high-pressure situations.",
    "ah.hero_p4": "If you are searching for the **best cabin crew training institute in Gujarat** or comparing **air hostess training course fees in Vadodara**, understand that the value lies not in the certificate alone, but in the infrastructure, faculty expertise, and placement track record that backs it.",

    // Section 2: Eligibility
    "ah.elig_title": "Who Can Apply? Eligibility Criteria for Cabin Crew",
    "ah.elig_intro": "This is where we address the real anxieties that keep young aspirants awake at night. We receive dozens of calls every week asking: *\"Am I too short?\"*, *\"I have some acne scars—will I be rejected?\"*, *\"I only studied till 12th—can I still become an air hostess?\"* Let us address each concern with honesty and practical guidance.",
    "ah.height_title": "Height Requirements: The Real Picture",
    "ah.height_intro": "Height is perhaps the most-searched eligibility criterion for aspiring cabin crew. Here is the reality: different airlines have different requirements, and there is more flexibility than most candidates assume.",
    "ah.height_female": "**Females:** Most domestic Indian airlines (Indigo, Air India, SpiceJet) require a minimum height of **155 cm (5'1\")**. International carriers like Emirates and Qatar Airways require **160 cm** or an arm-reach of **212 cm** while standing on tiptoes.",
    "ah.height_male": "**Males:** The minimum height for male cabin crew is typically **170 cm (5'7\")** for domestic airlines. International carriers may require **173-175 cm**.",
    "ah.height_reassurance": "**Reassurance for borderline candidates:** If you are within 1-2 cm of the minimum requirement, do not lose hope. Our grooming module includes **posture correction exercises** and techniques that can add up to 1-2 cm to your standing height. Proper posture, heel selection, and confidence during arm-reach tests have helped many of our students clear airline assessments.",
    "ah.skin_title": "Skin & Complexion: Addressing Sensitive Concerns",
    "ah.skin_intro": "Let us be direct: airlines look for a **clear, well-maintained complexion**—not perfection. Minor acne scars, birthmarks, or skin imperfections that can be concealed with standard makeup are generally acceptable. The key concerns airlines screen for are:",
    "ah.skin_item1": "Visible tattoos on exposed areas (face, neck, hands, lower arms)",
    "ah.skin_item2": "Severe scarring that cannot be concealed with foundation",
    "ah.skin_item3": "Active skin conditions that may be contagious",
    "ah.skin_p2": "At Wings Institute, our **in-house spa and skincare module** teaches you daily routines using natural home remedies. We also have **professional makeup stations** with hi-luminous mirrors where you practise the exact airline-standard makeup routine every single day. By the time you graduate, concealing minor imperfections becomes second nature.",
    "ah.edu_title": "Educational Qualification: The 12th Pass Advantage",
    "ah.edu_p1": "Here is excellent news for students who cannot afford or do not wish to pursue a 4-year degree: the minimum educational requirement for cabin crew positions is **12th Pass (10+2)** from a recognised board. This makes the cabin crew career path one of the most accessible high-paying professions for young Indians.",
    "ah.edu_p2": "However, do not mistake \"accessible\" for \"easy.\" Airlines receive lakhs of applications for a few hundred positions. What differentiates successful candidates is professional training, grooming, communication skills, and safety knowledge—precisely what we provide at Wings Institute.",

This is her story—and it could be yours.\"",

    "ah.morning_p2": "Our students start with **fitness and yoga sessions**—not the gym-bro kind, but airline-specific posture training. You learn to stand straight for hours without fatigue. You practice the 'cabin crew walk'—confident, graceful, purposeful. Airlines notice these things in interviews.",

    // Section 7: FAQ
    "ah.faq_title_seo": "Frequently Asked Questions About Air Hostess Training",
    "ah.faq_intro": "We receive hundreds of queries every month from aspiring cabin crew across Gujarat. Here are honest answers to the most common questions:",
    "ah.faq1_q": "Do I need to know swimming to become a cabin crew?",
    "ah.faq1_a": "**Not necessarily for joining our course**, but yes for airline selection. Most airlines require cabin crew to pass a basic swimming test (typically 25-50 metres without assistance) as part of their emergency training. If you cannot swim currently, we recommend enrolling in swimming classes during your course with us. Many of our students learn swimming while training at Wings—it is never too late to start.",
    "ah.faq2_q": "Can I join if I wear glasses or contact lenses?",
    "ah.faq2_a": "**Yes, absolutely.** Airlines accept candidates with corrected vision of 6/6 (or 6/9 correctable to 6/6). Both spectacles and contact lenses are permitted. However, for the interview and on-duty, most airlines prefer contact lenses for aesthetic uniformity. Candidates with very high prescriptions (above -5 or +5 diopters) should check specific airline requirements.",
    "ah.faq3_q": "What is the age limit for air hostess recruitment?",
    "ah.faq3_a": "For **domestic airlines** like Indigo and SpiceJet, the typical age range is **18-27 years** for freshers. **International airlines** like Emirates and Qatar Airways accept candidates up to **30-32 years**, and experienced crew can join even later. Our course is designed for candidates aged **17-26 years**, as this gives you the best window for placement.",
    "ah.faq4_q": "Is there any weight or BMI requirement for cabin crew?",
    "ah.faq4_a": "Airlines do not specify exact weight, but they require candidates to have a **proportionate weight-to-height ratio** (generally BMI between 18-25). Our in-house fitness centre and yoga sessions help students achieve and maintain healthy BMI throughout the course. We also provide nutrition guidance and diet plans.",
    "ah.faq5_q": "Can boys/males become cabin crew?",
    "ah.faq5_a": "**Absolutely yes!** Male cabin crew (often called flight stewards or flight attendants) are actively hired by all airlines. In fact, international carriers like Emirates and Singapore Airlines have a significant percentage of male cabin crew. At Wings Institute, approximately 30% of our cabin crew students are male, and they enjoy equal placement opportunities.",
    "ah.faq6_q": "What is the difference between Wings Institute diploma and the Indigo Cadet Program?",
    "ah.faq6_a": "The **Indigo ifly/Cadet Program** is a direct airline recruitment programme that trains you specifically for Indigo. Our **Wings Institute diploma** prepares you for *all* airlines—domestic and international. We also cover ground staff, hotel management, and travel agency roles, giving you multiple career options. Additionally, our alumni have been selected by Indigo, so our training is equally competitive.",
    "ah.faq7_q": "How many interviews will I get after completing the course?",
    "ah.faq7_a": "We provide **unlimited interview opportunities** until you are placed. Our placement cell actively tracks airline and hotel recruitment drives across India and sends eligible students for interviews. On average, committed students attend 5-10 interviews within 6 months of course completion. Some crack their first attempt; others may need multiple tries—we support you throughout.",
    "ah.faq8_q": "I am from a Gujarati medium school. Can I become cabin crew?",
    "ah.faq8_a": "**Yes, this is one of our specialities.** Over 70% of our students come from Gujarati or Hindi medium backgrounds. Our Cambridge Spoken English module starts from the basics—alphabets if needed—and transforms you into a confident English speaker. Many of our successful alumni, including those now flying with Qatar Airways, started with limited English proficiency.",
    "ah.faq9_q": "Are tattoos allowed for cabin crew?",
    "ah.faq9_a": "**Visible tattoos are generally not allowed.** Tattoos on the face, neck, hands, and lower arms (areas visible in uniform) will disqualify you from most airline selections. Tattoos that can be covered by the uniform (upper arms, back, legs) are typically acceptable. If you are considering a tattoo, we strongly advise waiting until after your airline career is established.",
    "ah.faq10_q": "Can I pursue a degree alongside the Wings Institute course?",
    "ah.faq10_a": "**Yes, our batches are designed for this.** Classes run part-time (Monday to Friday, 4 hours daily), allowing you to pursue BA, B.Com, or any distance/open university degree simultaneously. Many of our students complete their graduation while training with us, giving them both a degree and industry-ready skills.",

    // FAQ Section
    "tt.faq_seo_title": "Frequently Asked Questions: Travel & Tourism Course",
    "tt.faq_seo_intro": "Answers to the most common questions from aspiring travel professionals and their families:",
    "tt.seo_faq1_q": "What is GDS training and why is it important for travel careers?",
    "tt.seo_faq1_a": "GDS (Global Distribution System) is the software backbone of the travel industry. Amadeus, Galileo, and Sabre are the three major GDS platforms used by airlines, hotels, and travel agencies worldwide to book tickets, manage reservations, and access real-time inventory. Without GDS skills, you cannot work in airline ticketing, travel agencies, or corporate travel management. At Wings Institute, you get hands-on training on actual GDS terminals—not just simulations—making you immediately employable.",
    "tt.seo_faq2_q": "Can I open my own travel agency after this course?",
    "tt.seo_faq2_a": "Absolutely! Our curriculum is specifically designed for the Gujarati entrepreneurial mindset. You'll learn business registration (MSME, GST), IATA accreditation process, vendor tie-ups with hotels and transporters, tour costing and profit margins, and digital marketing for travel agencies. Many of our alumni like Vashisth Shukal, Jenil Patel, and Tauseef Patel have successfully started their own travel companies in Vadodara, Ahmedabad, and Dubai.",
    "tt.seo_faq3_q": "What is the difference between IATA and non-IATA travel agencies?",
    "tt.seo_faq3_a": "IATA-accredited agencies can issue airline tickets directly and earn higher commissions. Non-IATA agencies must book through consolidators, earning lower margins. While IATA accreditation requires a substantial security deposit (₹20-50 Lakhs), many successful agencies operate as non-IATA initially and grow into IATA status. Our course covers both models so you can choose the path that fits your investment capacity.",
    "tt.seo_faq4_q": "Is there demand for travel professionals after COVID-19?",
    "tt.seo_faq4_a": "The travel industry is experiencing a massive resurgence. India's domestic travel market grew 35% in 2023, and international departures have exceeded pre-pandemic levels. The demand for trained travel consultants—especially those skilled in visa processing and GDS operations—has never been higher. Companies are actively hiring to meet the pent-up travel demand, creating excellent opportunities for fresh graduates.",
    "tt.seo_faq5_q": "What is the salary of a travel consultant or ticketing agent in India?",
    "tt.seo_faq5_a": "Freshers typically start at ₹12,000-18,000 per month in travel agencies or airline GSAs (General Sales Agents). With 2-3 years of experience and GDS expertise, salaries rise to ₹25,000-40,000. Senior travel consultants and visa specialists earn ₹40,000-60,000. Travel agency owners and successful visa consultants can earn ₹1-5 Lakhs monthly depending on business volume.",
    "tt.seo_faq6_q": "Do you teach visa processing for all countries?",
    "tt.seo_faq6_a": "Yes, our curriculum covers visa processing for major destinations: USA (B1/B2), UK, Schengen (Europe), Canada, Australia, UAE, Singapore, and Thailand. You'll learn document checklists, appointment booking, form filling, cover letter drafting, and handling visa rejections. Visa consultancy is a high-margin business with minimal investment—many of our alumni run successful visa processing centres.",
    "tt.seo_faq7_q": "What software and systems will I learn in this course?",
    "tt.seo_faq7_a": "You'll get hands-on training on: Amadeus/Galileo GDS for flight bookings, hotel booking portals, travel CRM systems, visa application portals (VFS, BLS, etc.), currency exchange calculations, and Microsoft Office for itinerary documentation. These are the exact tools used by MakeMyTrip, Yatra, Thomas Cook, and independent travel agencies.",
    "tt.seo_faq8_q": "Can I work abroad after this travel and tourism course?",
    "tt.seo_faq8_a": "Yes! Dubai, Qatar, and Singapore have large travel and tourism sectors with demand for trained professionals. Many of our alumni work in travel agencies, airline offices, and tour operations in the Gulf. GDS skills are internationally recognised, and our Cambridge English certification helps with communication requirements for overseas positions.",
    "tt.seo_faq9_q": "What is the investment required to start a travel agency?",
    "tt.seo_faq9_a": "A basic home-based travel agency can start with ₹50,000-1 Lakh (computer, internet, GDS subscription). A proper office setup costs ₹2-5 Lakhs. For IATA accreditation, you'll need ₹20-50 Lakhs as security deposit. However, many successful agencies start as non-IATA and grow organically. Our course teaches you how to start lean and scale profitably.",
    "tt.seo_faq10_q": "Do I need to know English to work in travel and tourism?",
    "tt.seo_faq10_a": "Basic English is essential for GDS operations, visa documentation, and client communication—especially for international travel. However, you don't need to be fluent from day one. Our Cambridge Spoken English module takes students from vernacular backgrounds to professional English proficiency. Many successful travel agents in Gujarat primarily communicate in Gujarati/Hindi with local clients while handling English documentation.",
